Welcome to Colorado Springs! You can find us at the [OWASP Colorado Springs chapter homepage](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-colorado-springs/). We hope to be a community built chapter and want to explore locations around the city. We regularly meet at the National Cybersecurity Center (NCC), 
however some meetup locations may vary! Our meetups consist of workshops, speakers, and other technical infosec opportunities.
Technical knowledge is NOT required and all who are interested are welcome to attend our meetups. Join our Slack server to stay up to date!
