### John Mocuta - Finding and Submitting a Zero Day
August 29, 2024

#### Summary:
Finding a 0-Day & Getting a CVE

Context:

    John, a red-team specialist in network, web app, and hardware security, discovered a 0-day vulnerability in a client's 
    Robotic Process Automation (RPA) code, which had never been reviewed. John was also disappointed that RPAs had nothing
    to do with actually robots.

Options for Disclosure:

* No disclosure
    * Keep the vulnerability private--i.e. not discloused to anyone. 
* Full disclosure (public)
    * Release (possibly immediately) the details of the vulnerability to the public, without notifying the vendor first.
* Coordinated/Responsible disclosure (report to vendor first)
    * Report the vulnerability to the vendor first, allowing them time to fix it before publicly disclosing it.

Process:

    Submit a form at cve.mitre.org with product and version details. Example: CVE-2022-29856.
    Safe Harbor & Reporting

##### Key Concepts
Safe Harbor:

    Protection from legal repercussions when reporting vulnerabilities.

* Reporting Hierarchy:
    1. PR
    2. Legal
    3. InfoSec

* Austin Harbor Association - Allows anonymous reporting of vulnerabilities.
