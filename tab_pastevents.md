### [John Mocuta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atucom/) - August 29, 2024
### Finding a 0-Day & Getting a CVE 
#### Summary:

##### Context:

    John, a red-team specialist in network, web app, and hardware security, discovered a 0-day vulnerability in a client's 
    Robotic Process Automation (RPA) code, which had never been reviewed. John was also disappointed that RPAs had nothing
    to do with actual robots.

##### Process:
Submit a form at [cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/) with product and version details.
John's Submission: [CVE-2022-29856](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2022-29856)

##### Key Concepts
Options for Disclosure:
* No disclosure
    * Keep the vulnerability private--i.e. not discloused to anyone. 
* Full disclosure (public)
    * Release (possibly immediately) the details of the vulnerability to the public, without notifying the vendor first.
* Coordinated/Responsible disclosure (report to vendor first)
    * Report the vulnerability to the vendor first, allowing them time to fix it before publicly disclosing it.

* Safe Harbor: Protection from legal repercussions when reporting vulnerabilities.

* Reporting Hierarchy:
    1. PR
    2. Legal
    3. InfoSec

* Austin Harbor Association - Allows anonymous reporting of vulnerabilities.
