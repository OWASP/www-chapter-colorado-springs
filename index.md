Welcome!
-----------------

Welcome to the OWASP Colorado Springs Chapter! We are re-starting the chapter under the aegis of the chapter re-activation program. We are actively looking for more co-leaders, speakers, and to help decide the direction of the chapter, including social activities and get togethers once the COVID status drops from "Very High" to something a bit safer.

### Where do we meet?

At the moment, due to COVID, we don't meet physically. However, in the past we have met in person at SecureSet Academy. We will be discussing a return to our old location with SecureSet over the coming months.

### Upcoming Meetings

We schedule our meetings on the [Colorado Springs Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Colorado-Springs-Meetup/)

{% include chapter_events.html group=page.meetup-group %}

Our next meeting features Andrew van der Stock, the OWASP Top 10 co-lead on OWASP Top 10 2021 progress. It's a virtual event, and all are welcome. Depending on registration numbers, we might need to change from a Zoom call to a YouTube stream, so please do keep an eye on the event location once you have RSVP'd, as it may change.

* [Register here](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Colorado-Springs-Meetup/events/277899154/)

Our meetings are open to the public, and you do not need to be a member to attend. Please do consider [joining OWASP](https://owasp.org/membership/) if you find our community, projects, and meetings valuable, or sponsoring this chapter.

### Call for leaders

We are currently looking to build up our Leadership Team! If you are interested, please reach out to [Terry Bradshaw](mailto:terry.bradshaw@owasp.org) or [Andrew van der Stock](mailto:vanderaj@owasp.org).

### Call for speakers

Our goal is to make the OWASP Colorado Springs chapter a worldwide community of interest around defence and aerospace application security topics, which are two primary industries in the Colorado Springs area. If you feel you would like to talk about a topic along these lines, please come speak at our Chapter. As many of these topics are sensitive and our meetings are open to the public, please make sure you are cleared to talk prior to making a booking, and the information is publicly consumable. Additionally, we will be seeking talks on any topic relating to application security.

Please make sure you read the [speaker agreement](/www-policy/speaker-agreement) and email the chapter leaders ([Terry Bradshaw](mailto:terry.bradshaw@owasp.org) or [Andrew van der Stock](mailto:vanderaj@owasp.org)).
