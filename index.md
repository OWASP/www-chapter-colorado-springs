Welcome to the OWASP Colorado Springs Chapter!

OWASP Colorado Springs is BACK! with our next meeting August 25th at the National Cybersecurity Center! Check out the Upcoming Meetings Section for more detail!

### Where do we meet?

At the moment, due to COVID, we don't meet physically. However, in the past we have met in person at SecureSet Academy. We will be discussing a return to our old location with SecureSet over the coming months.

### Upcoming Meetings

Please Join [Colorado Springs Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Colorado-Springs-Meetup/) for more info!

Next Meeting! August 25th

{% include chapter_events.html group=page.meetup-group %}

Our meetings are open to the public, and you do not need to be a member to attend. Please do consider [joining OWASP](https://owasp.org/membership/) if you find our community, projects, and meetings valuable, or sponsoring this chapter.

### Call for leaders

We are currently looking to build up our Leadership Team! If you are interested, please reach out to [Terry Bradley](mailto:terry.bradley@owasp.org) or [Marc Sanchez](mailto:marc.sanchez@owasp.org).

### Call for speakers

Our goal is to make the OWASP Colorado Springs chapter a worldwide community of interest around defence and aerospace application security topics, which are two primary industries in the Colorado Springs area. If you feel you would like to talk about a topic along these lines, please come speak at our Chapter. As many of these topics are sensitive and our meetings are open to the public, please make sure you are cleared to talk prior to making a booking, and the information is publicly consumable. Additionally, we will be seeking talks on any topic relating to application security.

Please make sure you read the [speaker agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/) and email the chapter leaders ([Terry Bradshaw](mailto:terry.bradshaw@owasp.org) or [Marc Sanchez](mailto:marc.sanchez@owasp.org)).
